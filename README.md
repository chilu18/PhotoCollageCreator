# PhotoCollageCreator
This app takes a set of photos and combines them together after downscalingn them.

You can specify directories or files that are stored locally, and every image file will be recursively retrieved from the subdirectories. All images will be downscaled so that they fill the y-coordinate in 5-6 rows and they will be appended next to each other. The final result can be saved as a .png image.
